This is a summary for Homework 3 comprising 3 assignments.

As in the instructions, the Citibike project assignment was worked on in a group with Assel (AD4336).

My contribution so far was in brainstorming various hypoethesis to test;  loading the data ; prepping the data in a data frame 

The next steps are to count the total number of riders in each of the data sets for July 2016 and January 2016 and perform a statistical test to determine if July 2016 had greater than or equeal to the number of riders as the January 206 data set. 

The idea behind this analysis was that theree would be greater number of riders during the warmer summer months than the cooler winter months. The Null Hypothesis for this test was the number of riders in July 2016 is greater than or equal to the number of riders in  January 2016. The alternative hypthoseis is that the number of riders in July 2016 is less than the number of riders in January 2016.The alpha level is .05.
