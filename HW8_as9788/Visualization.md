For this assignment, we were asked to select a data set of urban relevance and visualize it in some way. 

The data set I selected is the newly released "NYCHA Public Purpose Shared Solar Opportunities" for New York City. 

The data describe available rooftop space for solar from LiDAR data collected for New York City for a subset of buildings. 

Because the data set includes latitude and longitude (location), a map based visualization might be useful for a policy maker 

or community group interested in selecting a site. The open data site already offers a map of all the locations in this data set. 

So in order to differentiate, I selected to map the points in various sizes tied to the estimated roof solar capacity in kw. 

In addition to varying point size, I also elected to use a heavier color for denser concentration of points so that it's easier to differentiate. 

The idea being that at first glance, one might see where is the greatest concentration of available rooftoop space ordered by solar capacity. 

Enjoy!
